## planning

  - /users/create
  - /roles

<!-- - components
  - sidebar done**

  - search bar done**
  - add new user done**
  - delete user
  - edit user

  - display navbar if window.scrollY > 100
  -->

- The things I always keep in mind
    - I had been calling "name" in localStorage instead of by combining "first name and last name."
    - I was deleting the data by without checking whether it was a number or a string. - eg: user.id !== userId (userId must be number)
